I've been fortunate to get hands on experience with:

* Windows administration
* Fortigate firewalls
* Virtualization platform such as:
  - VMWare

  - AVD(_Azure Virtual Desktop_)
  - *Entra ID*
  - SSO for enterprise applications
 
### I'm currently going through the *Learn to Cloud* guide to gain foundational knowledge in:
 1. Linux (**NOTE**: I went through Sander van Vught's _Red Hat RHCSA 9 (EX200)_ book)
 2. Python
 3. Network (**NOTE**: I Went through a full CCNA course from Jeremy's IT Lab and completed a lab that encompasses the course)
 4. Cloud (**NOTE**: My approach is to learn by doing so I will tackle on the _Cloud Resume Challenge_ early 2026)
 5. DevOps
    - K8
    - CI/CD
    - Containers (I've ran a few podman containers in RHEL but will focus on Docker)
    - IaC (Terraform specifically, I've done a bit of Terraform when deploying new AVD sessions) 
 6. Cloud Security
